## ü¶Ö 11.20.2023: Emerson [**recommended**](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1700523731/slcschoolsorg/h6gkywtiuvscmowlhtc0/SLCSDFURTHERSTUDYRECOMMENDATIONS.pdf) to stay open, but ELP/DLI will go to Nibley Park School. ü¶Ö

Hello, we are members of the Emerson Elementary community.

[Emerson](https://emerson.slcschools.org) is a public elementary school in Salt Lake City, Utah that is currently on a list for [potential closure](https://www.slcschools.org/departments/information-technology/boundaries-and-planning/population-and-boundary-study) despite the fact that it is a [nationally recognized school](https://nationalblueribbonschools.ed.gov/awardwinners/winning/21ut102pu_emerson_elementary_school.html).

Our mission is to create a hub for gathering and sharing information about Emerson with a passionate determination to ensure its continued operation.

## Per the [school district's policy](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1644869018/slcschoolsorg/da6w2cajvlh3tpfsacb0/g-5-policy-english.pdf), "all applicable factors will be considered" regarding school closures, including but not limited to the following:

- Enrollment data
- Facility capacity and design
- School feeder patterns (_the movement of students into higher level schools_)
- Federal, state, or court mandates
- Community input
- Student safety
- Transportation capacity
- Community and neighborhood identity
- Geographic features of the district
- Special program facilities
- Environmental factors
- Demographics
- Aesthetics
- Financial implications
- Educational programs

This site aims to provide insights into [each of these factors](https://www.slcschools.org/departments/information-technology/boundaries-and-planning/population-and-boundary-study/population-and-boundary-study-faq#fs-panel-81567), underscoring their significance in the preservation of Emerson Elementary. This site also highlights our human connection to the school with some demographics and school performance information along with our community input and feedback. **<u>Emerson is more than just a building, it is our students, teachers, admins/staff, and community.</u>**

## Accessibility and Safety

- Emerson is not in a major thoroughfare like 700 East so students are not playing by busy roads or having to cross 6-car lane traffic to get to/from school.
- Emerson still serves a lot of students in the neighborhood and the students bike or walk to/from school with their parents/caregivers.
- Redistricting of the children in Emerson‚Äôs boundaries will mean further walking distances, either across busy 700 East or up difficult hill (snowy during winter) on 1300 South.
- Emerson is the only school in the district with aftercare programs within .5 miles of walking distance from the school (like [Arte Primero Studios and St. John's CCDC Sugarhouse](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1621450917/slcschoolsorg/xyae2owyn1qmay2mws0s/Emersondaycares2021.pdf)).
- Classes are able to have safe walking field trips around the community (to [Little Free Libraries](https://littlefreelibrary.org), parks, post office, etc.).
- The city is [improving 1100 East](https://www.slc.gov/mystreet/2022/12/12/1100east/) near Emerson to ‚Äúprovide safety improvements, traffic calming features, and bicycle lanes along the corridor.‚Äù
- The city also has other projects near Emerson that will further help with students' access and safety to and from school: [800 East Neighborhood Byway](https://www.slc.gov/transportation/neighborhood-byways/800east/), [900 South Reconstruction](https://www.slc.gov/mystreet/2023/02/16/900-south-900-east-to-900-west/), [McClelland Trail Improvements](https://www.slc.gov/transportation/mcclelland-nsli/), and [Kensington Ave. Neighborhood Byway](https://www.slc.gov/transportation/neighborhood-byways/kensington/). These walking and biking improvements improve the neighborhood for families and the community.
- Emerson is accessible via [UTA](https://www.rideuta.com/Fares-And-Passes/Pass-Programs/UTA-School-Pass-Programs/Salt-Lake-City-School-District) bus routes 209 and 220.

## Cost to Operate (building, utilities, etc.)

Sourced from the [Salt Lake City School District Sustainability Action Plan](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1641931356/slcschoolsorg/irjphywgl0dtrb8n8in0/sustainability-resolution-english.pdf), Emerson has 6th lowest utility cost per student, 5th lowest emissions per student, 12th lowest Energy Use Intensity ('miles per gallon' of the school), and 9th lowest water usage compared to all elementary schools in the district.

Emerson has recently invested in upgrades that contributes to the school's energy-efficiency, with energy-saving lights and an installation of solar panels. These enhancements are projected to further lower the school's energy costs, ensuring a greener and more eco-conscious future.

Beyond its commitment to sustainability, Emerson thrives as a close-knit and [proactive community](https://ksltv.com/567053/deadline-nearing-for-utah-schools-to-get-free-air-purifiers/). The dedication of parents, teachers, and supporters knows no bounds, as evidenced by consistently surpassing [fundraising](https://m.facebook.com/photo.php/?fbid=719896109936485) goals. This remarkable achievement not only demonstrates unwavering community support, but also paves the way for enriching educational experiences.

Emerson parents volunteer at the school every day. Their active involvement not only fosters an inspiring learning environment where students flourish, but also serves as a cost-saving measure for the school. With dedicated volunteers generously giving their time and talents, the school can allocate resources more efficiently, redirecting funds towards enriching educational programs and further enhancing the student experience. Students are nurtured by the care and encouragement of those around them, benefiting from the invaluable contributions of our dedicated volunteers.

## Enrollment Trends

[**2023-2024 Enrollment Report**](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOGY4ODM0NzgtMWM5Yy00ZGEyLTlmMzUtMWUwNmM4YzBjNmVlIiwidCI6IjViNzg1OTg4LWQxNTktNDI1Ni05OWM2LTY0NzRhMDY5NmYxMyIsImMiOjZ9&pageName=ReportSection19df96761d8ed5812151)

Emerson continues to serve a significant number of students from its local neighborhood. Despite declining district-wide enrollment rates cited as a reason for potential closures, Emerson operates at 84% student capacity. Emerson does not seem to be among the lowest general education enrollment when regular school program enrollment is recorded with at least [355 students enrolled last year](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1674672795/slcschoolsorg/sggt8uoni0hckkbdgvte/FallEnrollment2022.pdf) and 362 students enrolled this year. It is the eight-highest in regular school program enrollment this year out of the 27 public elementary schools in Salt Lake City School District. It is also the third-highest in overall district public elementary school enrollment when adding Magnet ELP Int enrollment.

In Utah, parents have the choice of [open enrollment](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title53G/Chapter6/53G-6-S402.html) and many choose Emerson for its commitment to excellence.

As per the [district's definition](https://www.slcschools.org/departments/information-technology/boundaries-and-planning/population-and-boundary-study/population-and-boundary-study-faq#fs-panel-81544) of ‚Äúright-sized elementary school,‚Äù Emerson maintains a ratio of about three teachers per grade and offers full-day kindergarten classes.

## Proximity to Other Schools

In [Central City](https://g.co/kgs/txQADM)/[East Central](https://g.co/kgs/xUXFJU), a staggering four out of the seven schools find themselves on the list "recommended for further study for potential closure." Among them, Emerson and Hawthorne, situated in close proximity, face an uncertain future. Additionally, Bennion and Wasatch are also part of this list. [Notably, these four schools represent a substantial portion of the city, from lower Avenues to Sugarhouse.](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1603487005/slcschoolsorg/wwjqkrnpextfkgzwnlbg/district-boundary-map.pdf)

The loss of these four schools would significantly impact the fabric of this area, which can also be challenging to fill in the future. Emerson is a vital cornerstone of our community: it is a phenomenal public elementary school in the district that just works. The school ground also becomes a community gathering point/green space in the evenings when dog owners bring their dogs to the field, parents with babies and toddlers play in the playground, and students with their caregivers also stop by.

Emerson is in the center of SLCC, University of Utah, and Westminster University. To promote lifelong learning in the district and the state, Emerson should be kept open and more collaboration with the nearby college/universities should be promoted in elementary schools.

## Summary of Concerns

1. **Safety**: If Emerson closes, students will have to¬†cross dangerous streets like 700 East or 1300 East to get to school. There is no other public elementary school nearby where Emerson students can safely walk or bike to and from. Newly constructed raised crosswalks on 1100 East provide safer access to Emerson.

2.	**Vulnerable Students**: Emerson is home to a behavioral hub and special ed hub. Students¬†in these programs depend on the steady, supportive environment at Emerson. It might take years to establish the programs at another school, which is unfair to these vulnerable students.¬†¬†

3. **Learning Environment**: Despite being an older building, Emerson¬†is energy efficient, safe, and provides an effective learning environment for students. The building is able to meet the district's target of 400-500 neighborhood kids and house a¬†special program.

4. **Exceptional Education**: Emerson is a nationally awarded Blue Ribbon school. The [2022 state audit](https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2022-16_RPT.pdf) that recommended closing schools also recommended that the district use its high performing teachers and schools as models for other¬†schools. Emerson is a school to replicate, not a school to close.

5. **Human Impact**: [The district decided which schools they will study for possible closure based on building age without considering factors like school performance, student achievement, equity, and community impact.](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1689889156/slcschoolsorg/msnrax3oquvts0jx4b0i/Ranking.pdf) Before closing any schools, the district should evaluate and report on how closures will affect students, families, teachers, and communities.

6. **Community**: The district's current recommendations will hollow out the heart of the city which will affect who moves into our Central City neighborhoods for generations.

7. **Scope of Change**: Too many schools, too quickly. Closing 7 schools or 25% of the district's elementary schools is too much change¬†at once. The district cannot ensure a safe and smooth transition for that many kids,¬†especially our most vulnerable students. The district should close fewer schools now and develop a long-term plan for future closures.¬†

## Emerson Elementary History

Emerson was established in 1894, around the inception of this state ([24:01 in this video](https://youtu.be/14nB6U4BdiM?t=1441)). The current building is from the late 1970‚Äôs and was designed with energy conservation in mind. A book called ["101 Years of Emerson Elementary School: The Gift of Its Inspired Children"](https://catalog.slcpl.org/search/title.aspx?ctx=1.1033.0.0.7&pos=1&cn=56693) is available in the Main SLC Public Library‚Äôs Special Collections.
