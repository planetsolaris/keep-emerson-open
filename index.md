Hello, we are members of the Emerson Elementary community.

[Emerson](https://emerson.slcschools.org) is a public elementary school in Salt Lake City, Utah that is currently on a list for [potential closure](https://www.slcschools.org/departments/information-technology/boundaries-and-planning/population-and-boundary-study) despite the fact that it is a [nationally recognized school](https://nationalblueribbonschools.ed.gov/awardwinners/winning/21ut102pu_emerson_elementary_school.html).

Our mission is to create a hub for gathering and sharing information about Emerson with a passionate determination to ensure its continued operation.

## Per the [school district's policy](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1644869018/slcschoolsorg/da6w2cajvlh3tpfsacb0/g-5-policy-english.pdf), "all applicable factors will be considered" regarding school closures, including but not limited to the following:

- Enrollment data
- Facility capacity and design
- School feeder patterns (_the movement of students into higher level schools_)
- Federal, state, or court mandates
- Community input
- Student safety
- Transportation capacity
- Community and neighborhood identity
- Geographic features of the district
- Special program facilities
- Environmental factors
- Demographics
- Aesthetics
- Financial implications
- Educational programs

This site aims to provide insights into each of these factors, underscoring their significance in the preservation of Emerson Elementary. This site also highlights our human connection to the school with school performance and some demographics information along with our community input and feedback.

## Accessibility and Safety

- Emerson is not in a major thoroughfare like 700 East so students are not playing by busy roads or having to cross 6-car lane traffic to get to/from school.
- Emerson still serves a lot of students in the neighborhood and the students bike or walk to/from school with their parents/caregivers.
- Redistricting of the children in Emerson‚Äôs boundaries will mean further walking distances, either across busy 700 East or up difficult hill (snowy during winter) on 1300 South.
- Emerson is the only school in the district with aftercare programs within .5 miles of walking distance from the school (like [Arte Primero Studios and St. John's CCDC Sugarhouse](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1621450917/slcschoolsorg/xyae2owyn1qmay2mws0s/Emersondaycares2021.pdf)).
- Classes are able to have safe walking field trips around the community (to [Little Free Libraries](https://littlefreelibrary.org), parks, post office, etc.).
- The city is also [improving 1100 East](https://www.slc.gov/mystreet/2022/12/12/1100east/) near Emerson to ‚Äúprovide safety improvements, traffic calming features, and bicycle lanes along the corridor.‚Äù
- Emerson is accessible via [UTA](https://www.rideuta.com/Fares-And-Passes/Pass-Programs/UTA-School-Pass-Programs/Salt-Lake-City-School-District) bus routes 209 and 220.

## Cost to Operate (building, utilities, etc.)

Sourced from the [Salt Lake City School District Sustainability Action Plan](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1641931356/slcschoolsorg/irjphywgl0dtrb8n8in0/sustainability-resolution-english.pdf), Emerson has 6th lowest utility cost per student, 5th lowest emissions per student, 12th lowest Energy Use Intensity ('miles per gallon' of the school), and 9th lowest water usage compared to all elementary schools in the district.

Emerson has recently invested in upgrades that contributes to the school's energy-efficiency, with energy-saving lights and an installation of solar panels. These enhancements are projected to further lower the school's energy costs, ensuring a greener and more eco-conscious future.

Beyond its commitment to sustainability, Emerson thrives as a close-knit and proactive community. The dedication of parents, teachers, and supporters knows no bounds, as evidenced by consistently surpassing [fundraising](https://m.facebook.com/photo.php/?fbid=719896109936485) goals. This remarkable achievement not only demonstrates unwavering community support, but also paves the way for enriching educational experiences.

Emerson parents volunteer at the school every day. Their active involvement not only fosters an inspiring learning environment where students flourish, but also serves as a cost-saving measure for the school. With dedicated volunteers generously giving their time and talents, the school can allocate resources more efficiently, redirecting funds towards enriching educational programs and further enhancing the student experience. Students are nurtured by the care and encouragement of those around them, benefiting from the invaluable contributions of our dedicated volunteers.

## Enrollment Trends

Emerson continues to serve a significant number of students from its local neighborhood. As per the [district's definition](https://www.slcschools.org/departments/information-technology/boundaries-and-planning/population-and-boundary-study#fs-panel-80603) of ‚Äúright-sized elementary school,‚Äù Emerson maintains a ratio of about three teachers per grade and offers full-day kindergarten classes. In Utah, parents have the choice of [open enrollment](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title53G/Chapter6/53G-6-S402.html) and many choose Emerson for its commitment to excellence.

Despite declining enrollment rates cited as a reason for potential closures, Emerson operates at 85% student capacity, marking the second-highest enrollment rate within the Salt Lake City School District. The table sourced from the [State Board of Education](https://www.schools.utah.gov/data/reports?mid=1424&tid=4) emphasizes in bold the enrollment rates for Emerson as well as the other schools on the list for potential closure.

## Proximity to Other Schools

In [Central City](https://g.co/kgs/txQADM)/[East Central](https://g.co/kgs/xUXFJU), a staggering four out of the seven schools find themselves on the list "recommended for further study for potential closure." Among them, Emerson and Hawthorne, situated in close proximity, face an uncertain future. Additionally, Bennion and Wasatch are also part of this list. [Notably, these four schools represent a substantial portion of the city, from lower Avenues to Sugarhouse.](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1603487005/slcschoolsorg/wwjqkrnpextfkgzwnlbg/district-boundary-map.pdf)

The loss of these four schools would significantly impact the fabric of this area, which can also be challenging to fill in the future. Emerson is a vital cornerstone of our community: it is a phenomenal public elementary school in the district that just works. The school ground also becomes a community gathering point/green space in the evenings when dog owners bring their dogs to the field, parents with babies and toddlers play in the playground, and students with their caregivers also stop by.

## Ask the School Board:

ü¶Ö Decision comments or scoring information is not available on the [Boundary Options Committee's Spreadsheet](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1689889156/slcschoolsorg/msnrax3oquvts0jx4b0i/Ranking.pdf). Is this publicly available spreadsheet the same data/information that the Board is reviewing to make their decisions? What does the scoring mean? Where is the rubric for this data? How did the committee come up with the ranking when there's no meaning as to what the numbers are on their spreadsheet?\
\
ü¶Ö On August 1st, why did majority of the Board voted to move forward with keeping Emerson on the list of possible closure when parents provided them evidence-based data sourced from SLCSD's very own website (for example, [Fall Enrollment 2022](https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1674672795/slcschoolsorg/sggt8uoni0hckkbdgvte/FallEnrollment2022.pdf)) to prove that Emerson should not be on this list of 7 schools? How can the Emerson community be assured that the process is fair and their input is considered when Emerson wasn't removed on this list of 7 schools after the Board has been provided with Emerson information?\
\
ü¶Ö It does not take overnight to rebuild programs in other schools. Emerson is home to a number of established academic and special education programs. What is the timeline to rebuild those programs in which other schools?\
\
ü¶Ö What school would the Emerson neighborhood students go to if Emerson closes? How is the district going to ensure that support for students who are enrolled in Emerson because of its special education programs will be readily available in another school? How is the district going to support our teachers?\
\
ü¶Ö How much will it cost to close Emerson? What will happen to the "money saved" from closing Emerson? Will the district keep the land if Emerson closes?

## Other things to note:

- **Mentioned in the [Utah Legislature Audit](https://lag.utleg.gov/olag-doc/2022-16_RPT.pdf) 5 times and is a recommendation for the district, "in an effort to promote student proficiency and growth, should focus on identifying high performing teachers and schools, and replicating their successful practices with other teachers and schools where needed." Emerson is exactly this school that the district needs to identify and keep open.**
- Parents can't emphasize enough that Emerson is a school that just works: children are happy and thriving, teachers are dedicated and passionate, and the school leadership is highly commendable.
- Emerson has a diverse student body as the students come from different experiences (abilities/neurodiversity, cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds, etc.). The students are encouraged to collaborate and socialize with everyone in the school.
- The Emerson community values [clean air](https://ksltv.com/567053/deadline-nearing-for-utah-schools-to-get-free-air-purifiers/), inclusion, and progress. The city is already trying to better bridge Central City (east and west) with projects like [900 South Reconstruction](https://www.slc.gov/mystreet/2023/02/16/900-south-900-east-to-900-west/) and [Kensington Byway](https://www.slc.gov/transportation/neighborhood-byways/kensington/); Emerson is between these projects.

## Emerson Elementary History

Emerson was established in 1894, around the inception of this state ([24:01 in this video](https://youtu.be/14nB6U4BdiM?t=1441)). The current building is from the late 1970‚Äôs and was designed with energy conservation in mind. A book called ["101 Years of Emerson Elementary School: The Gift of Its Inspired Children"](https://catalog.slcpl.org/search/title.aspx?ctx=1.1033.0.0.7&pos=1&cn=56693) is available in the Main SLC Public Library‚Äôs Special Collections.
